  s.description      = <<-DESC
A lightweight, one line setup, network debugging library that provides a quick look on all executed network requests performed by your app. It grabs all requests - of course yours, requests from 3rd party libraries (such as AFNetworking or else), UIWebViews, and more. Very useful and handy for network related issues and bugs.
